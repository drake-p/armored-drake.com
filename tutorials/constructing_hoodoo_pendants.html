      <h1>Constructing Hoodoo Pendants</h1>
      <h3>a.k.a. Compass Rose / Sunburst / etc.</h3>
This tutorial
explains how to make my favorite pendant, the&nbsp;<a href="../jewelry/base/necklace-compass.html">Compass Rose</a>.&nbsp;
It is a tricky bugger to make, so I&rsquo;ve tried to be as helpful
as possible as far as hints and tricks go.<br>



      <br>



The only ring size combination I&rsquo;ve used (since the
piece is perfectly sized for a pendant) is:<br>



16 ga 3/16&rdquo; ID (0.064&rdquo; WD, 0.2055&rdquo; ID)<br>



12 ga 7/16&rdquo; ID (0.100&rdquo; WD, 0.474&rdquo; ID)<br>



Note that the design is very sensitive to variations in ring
size.&nbsp; (Seriously &ndash; the difference between
TRL&rsquo;s machine cut 16316 Stainless and my hand-cut of the same
equals the difference between a pendant that works and one that
doesn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Why do you think I bothered with caliper
measurements?)&nbsp; <br>



      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Advice #1</span>:&nbsp; Be wary of gauge systems,
because AWG vs SWG will throw you for a loop.&nbsp; I tried doing
one of these in 16 ga 3/16&rdquo; sterling silver, but since sterling is
non-ferrous and goes by a different gauge system than stainless, my
actual wire diameter was a full 0.013&rdquo; too small.&nbsp;
Be sure you know your rings&rsquo; actual stats before you try
using them for this project.<br>



      <br>


      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
Advice #2</span>:&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re going to do this in a tough
metal (say, stainless, as used in this tutorial), get yourself the
proper pliers.&nbsp; I recommend:&nbsp;<br>
      <table style="text-align: left; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 883px; height: 773px;" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">

        </tbody>
      </table>
      <br>



On the other hand, don&rsquo;t go out of your way to do what I say
&ndash; these are just recommendations, and you&rsquo;ll
probably want to go with what&rsquo;s most comfortable to you.<br>



      <br>



Right.&nbsp; On to making the pendant.<br>



      <br>



1.&nbsp; Pre-close eight rings, 16 ga 3/16&rdquo; in stainless
(or whatever metal you want for the main body of your pendant).<br>



      <img style="width: 400px; height: 279px;" alt="step 1" src="images/pendant_step1.jpg"><br>



      <br>



2.&nbsp; Connect these eight into a simple 1-1-1 chain totaling 15
rings (you only need 7 open rings).<br>



      <img style="width: 400px; height: 183px;" alt="step 2" src="images/pendant_step2.jpg"><br>



      <br>



3.&nbsp; Make a second chain of the same dimensions, same
metal.&nbsp; Lay them next to each other as shown.&nbsp; Pay
close attention two how the&nbsp;leftmost rings of each chain line up:
each should be leaning away from the other.&nbsp; The next two
should be leaning toward each other.<br>



      <img style="width: 400px; height: 189px;" alt="step 3" src="images/pendant_step3.jpg"><br>



      <br>



4.&nbsp; Now you are ready to start connecting the two chains into
a single chain of Hoodoo.&nbsp; If you aren&rsquo;t familiar
with making Hoodoo in this manner (shame on you! :P) have a look at <a href="constructing_hoodoo.html">this</a>
tutorial, steps 2-4.<br>

      <img style="width: 400px; height: 175px;" alt="step 4" src="images/pendant_step4.jpg"><br>


      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
Advice #3</span>:&nbsp; If you have trouble accessing the rings down the
center, now would be a good time to make use of those serrated
bent-nose pliers.&nbsp; They have a good small nose, but they also
grip the rings exceedingly well.&nbsp; Also, if you can&rsquo;t
get good leverage to bend the rings, brace your knuckles against your
thighs.&nbsp; Your leg muscles are much stronger than your wrist
muscles, and chances are they aren&rsquo;t doing much at the
moment, so you may as well make use of them.<br>



      <br>



5.&nbsp; Get the full length of your two chains converted into
Hoodoo like so.<br>



      <img style="width: 400px; height: 189px;" alt="step5" src="images/pendant_step5.jpg"><br>



      <br>



6.&nbsp; We interrupt this program for a brief advertisement.<br>



      <br>


      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
Advice #4</span>:&nbsp; TRL&rsquo;s machine cut stainless (used here)
makes a pretty borderline tight pendant.&nbsp; So, I sometimes throw in a ring
or two of an *ever* so slightly larger diameter, which is usually
enough to ease things up.&nbsp; By &ldquo;slightly&rdquo;
larger, I mean a difference of maybe 0.01&rdquo;, or less than
1/64&rdquo; &ndash; small enough that there will be virtually
no visual difference.&nbsp; How do you get so fine a
distinction?&nbsp; Even something so small as machine cut vs hand
cut can do it.&nbsp; If that isn&rsquo;t an option for you, it
probably wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to just use a couple rings of
13/64&rdquo; ID instead of 3/16&rdquo;.<br>



      <br>



Right.&nbsp; With that in mind, at this point I normally check to
see if I&rsquo;m going to need to add in any rings of larger
ID.&nbsp; So, curl the chain around in a circle, straighten out any
wonky rings, and see if you can make the end rings come within a
millimeter or two of touching.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be afraid to
strain it &ndash; stainless is tough.&nbsp; It can take
it.&nbsp; For best results, the final piece needs to be under some tension anyway.<br>



      <img style="width: 400px; height: 371px;" alt="step 6" src="images/pendant_step6.jpg"><br>



Looks like I get to use all one ring size on this one.&nbsp;
(The end rings would come closer if I didn&rsquo;t need my other hand
for camera operation.)<br>



      <br>



7.&nbsp; Straighten the chain out again and add two rings, one onto
each end.&nbsp; If the chain passed the 1-2 mm test, good on you,
and use the regular 16 3/16&rdquo; rings.&nbsp; If it looked
like it would be too much of a strain to make the ends touch, then you
might want to go with the rings of slightly larger diameter.<br>



      <img style="width: 450px; height: 176px;" alt="step 7" src="images/pendant_step7.jpg"><br>



      <br>



8.&nbsp; Right.&nbsp; At this point, you&rsquo;ve put
together 46 rings out of 58 total that you will end up
needing.&nbsp; Only two remain in this size and metal.&nbsp;
But those last two rings will be the worst utter bloody heck you could
ever dream of.&nbsp; If this is your first try, don&rsquo;t be
surprised if you spend at least five or ten minutes on the next few
steps.&nbsp; (er&hellip;wait, I&rsquo;m trying to be
encouraging here&hellip; Maybe you&rsquo;ll get lucky
&ndash; it is altogether feasible that your rings will have enough
deviance from mine that they will go together perfectly.&nbsp; :D)<br>



      <br>



So, get an open ring ready and grab those toothed bent-nose.&nbsp;
Ease the ring through one of the end rings and the last center ring as
shown:<br>



      <img style="width: 476px; height: 319px;" alt="step 8" src="images/pendant_step8.jpg"><br>



      <br>



9.&nbsp; Now bring the chain around in a circle.&nbsp; (This
would be a good time to skim ahead for a look at Advice #5.)<br>



Mmkay?&nbsp; Now, your open ring will go through two rings on the
other end, just like the ones it already has.&nbsp; If you get
confused, try looking at the rings around it to see how the pattern
works.&nbsp; This seam is a continuous piece of the rest of the
chain.<br>



      <img style="width: 450px; height: 472px;" alt="step 9" src="images/pendant_step9.jpg"><br>



Getting this ring into place will probably take a little horsing
around, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be *all* that hard.&nbsp; Just
remember that you shouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to stress the chain a
little. &nbsp;If it really gives you a tough time, try&nbsp;the larger-ID rings.<br>



      <br>


      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
Advice #5</span>:&nbsp; When you bring the chain around in a circle,
notice how some rings slant out on the inner edge (blue on pic below)
and others slant out at the perimeter (green).&nbsp; Try to make
your open ring one of the ones that slants out at the perimeter,
because it will be much easier to access that way.&nbsp; If you do
it that way, your open ring will look just like these pictures.<br>



      <img style="width: 400px; height: 392px;" alt="advice 5" src="images/pendant_advice5.jpg"><br>



      <br>



10.&nbsp; Time to get out those 12 ga 7/16&rdquo;
rings.&nbsp; Close them and wrestle them into place, captured in
the center of the circle.&nbsp; (Nothing holds these rings in place
except the edges of the rings around them, which form a bit of a rim on
either side.&nbsp; This is the main reason that it is so important
to have the chain very stiff &ndash; if the finished pendant can
flex, these center rings can fall out even after you close off the
chain.)<br>



      <img style="width: 400px; height: 396px;" alt="step 10" src="images/pendant_step10.jpg"><br>


      <span style="font-weight: bold;">
Advice #6</span>:&nbsp; The size of these center rings can be just as
delicate as that of the stainless ones around them.&nbsp; You may
need to tweak their diameter by trimming a bit off one end &ndash;
like the kerf from a saw.&nbsp; Try taking maybe 1-2mm.&nbsp;
Oh, and with that there&rsquo;s one silly mistake that is really
easy to make, so I&rsquo;ll caution you here before you discover it
for yourself.&nbsp; If your rings are shear-cut (as in aviation
snips, cable cutters, machine cut, etc) and you use shear cutters to do
this trimming, watch the notch on the top of the cut!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t cut so that you get that notch on both sides.&nbsp;
If the descending jaw on your cutters is on the left, then that notch
should be on the left as well.&nbsp; Otherwise, instead of a cut
like --\\-- you will have one like --/\--.<br>



      <img style="width: 400px; height: 283px;" alt="advice 6" src="images/pendant_advice6.jpg"><br>



You&rsquo;ll then have to correct the ring back to a
circle.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a perfect circle, but
get it reasonably close.<br>



      <br>



11.&nbsp; Almost done! but now we&rsquo;re ready to face the
biggest durn bear in the whole durn forest.&nbsp; The last ring is
the one opposite the ring from Steps 8-9, which will complete the joint
between the two ends of the chain.&nbsp; Start by putting it
through those two rings on the right (one center ring, one on the
edge)&hellip;<br>


      <img style="width: 400px; height: 390px;" alt="step 11 a" src="images/pendant_step11.jpg"><br>



&hellip;and now, give it all hell until it goes through the mirror
rings on the left.&nbsp; Yeah, in stainless, it pretty much takes
all hell to get it through.&nbsp; When you get it, you&rsquo;ll
have this really satisfying sensation of &ldquo;Hah!&nbsp; I
WIN!&nbsp; Take that, you sucker rings!&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s
your daddy?&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s your daddy?&nbsp;
Hahahahaha!!!&rdquo;&hellip;or, you know, maybe not that
extreme.<br>



 <img style="width: 552px; height: 414px;" alt="***insert expletives***" src="images/pendant_step11b.jpg">&nbsp;<img style="width: 400px; height: 414px;" alt="step 11 c" src="images/pendant_step11c.jpg"><br>


Close that ring once you get it through all four.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t slip&amp;jab yourself.&nbsp; Use toothed pliers.<br>



      <br>



12.&nbsp; Okay, after that, you deserve a nice, easy
finish.&nbsp; These last eight rings are under almost no stress
whatsoever, meaning that they are pretty easy to get into
place.&nbsp; They are the peripheral rings that serve as the points
of the compass (or the rays of the sunburst, or the spokes of the Wheel
of Life, or&hellip;you get the idea).<br>



      <img style="width: 400px; height: 221px;" alt="step 12" src="images/pendant_step12.jpg" align="top"><img style="width: 400px; height: 400px;" alt="finished" src="images/pendant_finished.jpg">&nbsp;<br>



Once you&rsquo;ve got the basic form, you can do any number of
variations.&nbsp; Replace four of the brass rings with copper, and
you get cardinal points:<br>



      <img style="width: 400px; height: 409px;" alt="cardinals" src="images/pendant_cardinals.JPG"><br>

      <br>



I fancy, if done in red and pink Anodized Aluminum, it could be made to
look like a rose.&nbsp; In Bright Aluminum and Blue AA, if one
could tweak the sizes to fit a six-pointed configuration, it might make
a nice snowflake.<br>



      <br>



Then there&rsquo;s the option of inverting the peripheral rings, an
idea which I&rsquo;ve played with a bit. &nbsp;Looks really geometric:<br>



      <img style="width: 400px; height: 369px;" alt="inverted" src="images/pendant_inverted.jpg"><br>



      <br>

Fellow mailler Kim Lechner has created a stunning precious metals version of the pendant with a Swarovski crystal cosmic ring as the centerpiece, which (with her permission) I simply have to share.  She notes, however, that the crystal is prone to falling out and will need to be glued or otherwise secured. <br>

<br>

Anyway, Hoodoo pendants are funnnnnn&hellip;<br>
