      <h1 style="text-align: center;">Basics of Chainmaille</h1>

      
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Introduction to the&nbsp;materials&nbsp;and&nbsp;equipment&nbsp;</h3>

Before you even pick up your pliers to start weaving chainmaille, you
must either find or become a source for rings.&nbsp; This tutorial
demonstrates how to make rings
for various purposes, and some of the other things you will need to
know to start your chainmaille career.<br>



      <br>



The first thing you need for chainmaille, as said, is rings (or links;
"circles" works too, but that's not a&nbsp;conventional
name).&nbsp; Of course, you can call up a chainmaille supplier if you
want, but that can be expensive if you're not even sure that you
want to keep going with chainmaille.&nbsp; Making your own links is
fairly easy and, once you've got the basic equipment, it is only as expensive as the wire you use to make them.<br>



      <br>

Wire is the first thing you need.&nbsp; Galvanized steel is cheap,
easy to acquire, and easy to work with, so it is recommended for a
beginner.&nbsp; Rustle around your basement, go dumpster-diving, or if
you're willing to put down a few bucks for a fresh 100 yd spool, go to
your local hardware store.&nbsp; I find that I work mostly with 14 and
16 ga wire; these are good gauges to start with, and, along with 17 ga,
are the easiest to find in galvanized steel.&nbsp; (I'm not going to
get into the finesse of the various gauge systems here; it's such a
headache, and &nbsp;besides,&nbsp;if you get to the point where you
really care about wire diameter, you'll use absolute decimal
measurements.)<br>



      <br>



Once you've got your wire, you need to set up a mandrel.&nbsp; This is
easy.&nbsp; Find a long board (three feet maybe; use something cheap but
sturdy, like plywood or bottom-of-the-line maple.)&nbsp; At each end, nail down a block of wood
with a hole drilled through each at&nbsp;the same height.&nbsp; Here is a
picture of mine:<br>



      <img style="width: 432px; height: 275px;" alt="mandrel" src="../tools/Images/Tools_mandrel.JPG"><br>


It's a little showy, with the wood finials instead of simple blocks,
and a nice stain to finish it. Yours doesn't have to be anywhere near
this fancy.<br>



      <br>

To complete the mandrel, you need a long bar.&nbsp; Use steel, not a
wooden dowel, because the wood will compress over time and result in
smaller-diameter rings each time. &nbsp;The rod should be a little over
a foot longer than the base board -- most hardware stores (the novice
mailler's best friend) carry bar stock in three-foot lengths.&nbsp; I
recommend 7/16" or 3/8"
diameter to begin with; you can always add to your collection.<br>

      <br>

Bend one end into a crank.&nbsp; To do this, start
about a foot from the end and make a 90 degree angle.&nbsp; You'll want
access to a vice grip for this, especially if you're using a 7/16"
diameter rod or larger. &nbsp;(I really don't recommend 1/2", because
you just won't be able to make a nice bend.) &nbsp;Notching the metal
slightly with a hacksaw can help if it's being stubborn. &nbsp;Make a
second 90 degree angle about six inches from the end, in the opposite
direction from the first.&nbsp; So, it should look something like this:<br>



      <img alt="crank for mandrel" src="images/crank_for_mandrel.jpg" style="width: 221px; height: 44px;"><br>


 <br>


Once you've bent the mandrel, slip it
through the two holes in the upright blocks of wood, all the way up to
the first bend of the crank.&nbsp; Make a mark on the bar, about an inch from where
it emerges from the block of wood on the crank end.&nbsp; In other
words, here:<br>



      <img alt="where to mark the mandrel" src="images/mandrel_mark.jpg" style="width: 221px; height: 44px;"><br>


The extra inch is to allow room for the crank to rotate, so that it doesn't rub right against the wood.<br>


      <br>


Take out the bar and find the mark.&nbsp; On that spot, drill a small hole all the way through the bar.&nbsp; This is
where you will insert the wire end for winding links, so make the hole
big enough to accommodate the wire gauge you are using.<br>



      <br>



That's all there is to the mandrel.&nbsp; Once you have this part done,
you are ready to wind links.&nbsp; Clamp the mandrel down onto a table
or desk or something, because you won't want it moving around while you
wind links.<br>



      <br>


It must first be understood that you do not wind links one at a
time.&nbsp; Rather, you make a long coil of wire, which is then cut
into links.&nbsp; The mandrel is for making the coil.&nbsp; To do this,
take the end of the wire and insert it into the hole you drilled in the
steel bar.&nbsp; You don't need to put much wire through; just so
that the end is visible on the other side of the bar.&nbsp; Then,
feeding the wire through your hand, start turning the crank.&nbsp; Take
it slowly until you get comfortable feeding the wire; you want to keep
the coil even.&nbsp; Avoid big gaps in the coil, and also avoid
overlapping the wire.&nbsp; You may want to wear a glove on the hand
you use to feed the wire, just to avoid injury from the wire rubbing
directly against your skin.<br>



      <br>



Make the coil as long as you like, but if you fill the entire space
between the wood blocks, it may be difficult to get the coil off.&nbsp;
The longer the coil, of course, the more links you will get out of
it.&nbsp; Once you have finished winding the coil, snip off the
leftover wire.&nbsp; You can then either pry the wire end out of the
hole drilled in the mandrel, or cut it off.&nbsp; Then draw the
crank out of the wood blocks, simultaneously
pulling off the coil, <span style="font-style: italic;">et
voila!&nbsp; </span>Your first coil of links!<br>



      <img style="width: 500px; height: 216px;" alt="coil of rings" src="images/Tools_coils.jpg"><br>



      <br>

Next you must cut the coil into links.&nbsp; There are various tools
you can use for this.&nbsp; My favorite cutters are a pair of cable
cutters from Ace Hardware.&nbsp; Wiss M5 aviation
snips are also quite popular.&nbsp; Both of these will produce a nice,
clean flush cut, with the ends like so: //.&nbsp; You
can also use diagonal cutters (cuts like so: &nbsp;&gt;&lt;), which I
find are
hard to use and do not produce very nice cuts.&nbsp; If you don't care
about cuts and just want something that will give you good leverage, 8"
bolt cutters are another popular tool. &nbsp;I don't recommend them for
jewelry (at all, ever), but they are excellent for big, steel armor
rings.<br>

      <br>
All right, you've got your mandrel, you've made a coil, you've cut it
into links.&nbsp; All that remains is to start weaving.&nbsp; You'll
want pliers for this, unless you made, like, 16 ga 3/4" ID links. &nbsp;(Those
would be ridiculously big and weak, and useless for...everything, I
think.)&nbsp;
There are a whole lot of plier kinds out there, and no one type is
necessarily better than the other.&nbsp; However I can give you a
general idea of what to use for what.<br>


      <br>



Slipjaw pliers:&nbsp; I've never used these, but lots of people do, so
I guess they must be pretty much all-purpose.<br>


      <br>


      <img style="width: 216px; height: 66px;" alt="linesmans pliers" src="../tools/Images/Tools_pliers_linesmans.JPG"><br>

Linesman's pliers:&nbsp; Big pliers with a solid grip and blunt,
toothed jaws. &nbsp;These are what I use when I'm dealing with 14
and 16 ga.&nbsp; I generally have one pair of these in my right hand,
and a smaller pair of pliers in my left.<br>



      <br>


Needlenose pliers:&nbsp; Extremely long, narrow, tapering jaws. &nbsp;I use them so rarely, I don't even have a
picture.&nbsp; If serrated, they are
handy when you need good traction in a dense weave, like Elfweave or
Half Persian 3-1 Sheet 6-1. &nbsp;Some people like to use them as their
primary pliers, but I find that the nose is too long and narrow for a
proper grip.<br>



      <br>


      <img style="width: 216px; height: 100px;" alt="chainnose pliers" src="../tools/Images/Tools_pliers_favchainnose.JPG"><br>

Chainnose pliers:&nbsp; Next to linesman's pliers, I use
these pliers the most often.&nbsp; They have short, pointed jaws, not a
long as needlenose pliers, and I've never seen any that had serrated
jaws. &nbsp;I use them as left-hand pliers to
complement my linesman's pliers, for 16 and 14 ga.&nbsp; I also use
them when I work with jewelry links, because the smooth gripping
surface doesn't scar the
metal.&nbsp; For links 20 ga and under, I just use these whatever the
metal because it's overkill to have a huge pair of pliers for something
so small.<br>



      <br>


      <img style="width: 216px; height: 103px;" alt="bentnose pliers" src="../tools/Images/tools_pliers_bentnose.jpg"><br>

Bent-nose pliers:&nbsp; Similar to needle-nose, but with a 45&ordm;
bend in the jaw. &nbsp;This effectively makes them a combination of
chain-nose and linesman's pliers, depending on how you hold them.
&nbsp;With the tip facing in toward the ring, they're chain-nosed; flip
them over, and you can use the outer edge of the angle to get a solid
linesman's-style grip. &nbsp;I have a pair of ACE brand bent-nose with
serrated jaws that I
really
like.&nbsp; They are about the burliest 4" pliers that I have found
yet,
which makes them perfect for small but strong links, or to complement
my linesman's pliers.&nbsp; And they have really nice, well-cushioned
grips, always a plus.<br>



      <br>


      <img style="width: 216px; height: 105px;" alt="roundnose pliers" src="../tools/Images/Tools_pliers_roundnose.jpg"><br>

Roundnose pliers:&nbsp; I don't actually use these to bend links.
&nbsp;I mean, you could, but they'd dent the metal and wouldn't even
give you a particularly good grip.&nbsp; But they're useful for making
neat
loops on clasps and things, so if you think you may get into chainmail
jewelry it's nice to have a pair of these around.<br>



      <br>



A final note:&nbsp; Metals<br>



There are probably fifteen or twenty different metals out there that are good for
chainmaille.&nbsp; That's a lot, when you think about it.&nbsp; So
here's a quick guide to the most common metals.<br>


      <br>



      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Galvanized steel</span>
(steel with zinc coating):&nbsp;
Cheap, strong, easy to acquire.&nbsp; Good for pretty much anything
apart from jewelry; most people use it for practice.&nbsp; Dull greyish
look to it, but can be blackened
through various processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's notorious for its distinct
odor, which some people don't mind but others can't stand. &nbsp;I've
also noticed that my galvy armor leaves a really unpleasant sticky
sensation after I've worn it for a couple of hours.<br>



      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stainless steel</span>:&nbsp;
Cheapish, strong, slightly harder to find in wire than
galvanized.&nbsp;
Good for anything, including basic jewelry.&nbsp; Bright grey, with
almost a
hint of brown, and it doesn't&nbsp;discolor under day-to-day
circumstances. &nbsp;However, it can be colored with a torch, and a
glossy&nbsp;blackened version can be bought (but not, to my knowledge,
made at home).<br>



      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aluminum</span> (or, depending on where you live, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">aluminium</span>):&nbsp;
A very lightweight, somewhat weak metal.&nbsp; Several kinds: all are
generally carried by a chainmaille supplier, for a little more than the
cost of steel.&nbsp; Good for jewelry, costume armor, or combat armor
in a heavy enough gauge.&nbsp; Plain aluminum is light grey, rubs off
dark residue.&nbsp; Bright aluminum is bright whitish-grey, and
mostly clean.&nbsp; Etched aluminum, which has been bathed in acid to
alter the surface of the metal, is dull whitish-grey and clean, but
loses its etching to become plain aluminum over time.<br>



      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anodized aluminum:</span>&nbsp;
Aluminum whose surface has been treated to give it a color. &nbsp;It
has the same workability properties as plain aluminum, but is slightly
more expensive.&nbsp; Comes in several colors and is good for inlays
and
colorful jewelry.&nbsp; Also, due to the layer of anodization, it does
not have any ruboff. &nbsp;The color does wear off after a year or two
of use.<br>



      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Copper:</span>&nbsp;
A pretty weak, heavier-than-steel, fairly cheap metal (but more
expensive than steel), commonly stocked by hardware stores
in a limited range of gauges.&nbsp; Good for jewelry, inlays,
trim.&nbsp; Shiny reddish-pink color when polished, but tarnishes
easily to dark brown and often leaves a greenish residue on skin.<br>

      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brass:</span>&nbsp;
Copper alloyed with zinc. &nbsp;Gold color that tarnishes to
dark yellow, and the copper in it rubs off a greenish residue.
&nbsp;Fairly cheap, moderately weak, fairly easy to acquire, just a
little heavier than steel. &nbsp;Good
for jewelry, inlays, trim.<br>



      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bronze:</span>&nbsp; Copper alloyed with tin.&nbsp; Dark red color that tarnishes to dark
brown. &nbsp;A weak but springy, reasonably cheap metal that is stocked by most chainmaille
suppliers.&nbsp; Weight similar to brass. &nbsp;Good for inlays, trim, decorative armor, and jewelry.<br>



      <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Enameled copper:</span>&nbsp;
Copper with a thin, colored plastic coating. &nbsp;Dead-soft,
reasonably cheap, to be found at a chainmaille
supplier.&nbsp; Good for inlays, jewelery, trim, that kind of
thing.&nbsp; Any color you can imagine, in jewel tones. &nbsp;Silvered
enameled copper has a silver plating under the enamel layer, which
shines through to produce even brighter colors.<br>



      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sterling silver</span>:&nbsp;
92.5% silver, plus copper and sometimes a couple other base metals.
&nbsp;Much more expensive than the basic metals like steel -- as of 4/17/08,
encroaching on $20/oz&nbsp;--&nbsp;but all jewelry suppliers should stock it in
various gauges.&nbsp; It's the classic metal for jewelry, bright white when
polished.&nbsp; Silver wire can
also be gotten with a copper core, which is cheaper than solid
sterling. &nbsp;Silver-plate wire is a thin layer of pure silver over a
copper core, and with normal wear over time will show the copper
beneath. &nbsp;Silver-fill is a silver tube filled with copper, and because
of the thickness of the silver layer, it is much less likely to wear
down to the core.<br>

      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gold:</span>&nbsp; Quite weak, rather expensive, stocked by most jewelry suppliers.&nbsp;
Best for jewelry, naturally.&nbsp; Bright yellow color.&nbsp; Like
sterling silver, this can be gotten with a copper or brass core.<br>



      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Craft wire:</span>&nbsp;
To my knowledge, this is no different from enameled copper, but I
figured I'd list it nonetheless.&nbsp; Weak, easy to come by for a
decent price at jewelry supply stores, Hobby Lobby, the like.&nbsp; Good for inlays,
jewelry.&nbsp; Lots of colors, but stores usually only stock the basic ones -- red, green, blue, black, silver, gold.<br>



      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Neoprene/EPDM rubber O-rings:</span>&nbsp;
Rings that are actually molded instead of coiled and cut, and so are
permanently closed. &nbsp;Elasticy and extremely lightweight (rubber is
half the weight of aluminum). &nbsp;They can only be ordered and not
made at home, for obvious reasons. &nbsp;Some chainmaille suppliers
stock them, as well as Fire Mountain Gems jewelry supplies (they call
them Oh! rings). &nbsp;Can be woven into bracelets with regular metal
rings to
give an interesting stretch factor.&nbsp; Black, plus a few other basic
colors are to be found. &nbsp;Unfortunately, they&nbsp;weaken over
time, and after a year or two of wear they tend to break.<br>



      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Titanium, niobium,
inconel, etc:</span>&nbsp; Very nice but expensive metals, hard to find
except
via a chainmaille supplier.&nbsp; Can be anodized to various colors
depending on the metal concerned.&nbsp; Titanium in particular is light
and strong, which makes it the uber armor metal; I think the others are
only good for jewelry although I really am not familiar with their
properties.<br>



      <br>



I know I've mentioned the words "chainmaille supplier" several times
now, so I'll list a couple that I know of here.<br>



The Ring Lord -- when I have to order links, this is where I go.&nbsp;
He's got everything you can imagine and more.&nbsp; However, he is based
in Saskatchewan, Canada, so beware the shipping if you don't happen to be
in Canada or the US.&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theringlord.org/">theringlord.com</a><br>

Blue Buddha Boutique -- Artist based in Chicago. &nbsp;I've heard good
things about her anodized aluminum rings. &nbsp;She also sells finished
pieces and does a lot of workshops. &nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://bluebuddhaboutique.com/">bluebuddhaboutique.com</a><br>

Non-chainmaillle (wire and jewelry things):<br>
Para Wire -- I drool over their mutiple gauges of craft wire.
&nbsp;Ringlord has at least as many colors, but none above 19 ga; these
folks stock up to 12 ga. &nbsp;Can you imagine?&nbsp; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.parawire.com/">parawire.com</a><br>

Fire Mountain Gems -- If you're interested in jewelry, here's a good
place to go. &nbsp;They have a wide selection of beads, clasps, and
findings, as well as the colored Oh! rings mentioned above. &nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.firemountaingems.com/">firemountaingems.com</a><br>

      <br>

      <a href="http://www.armchair-armoury.co.uk/"></a>

And there are many others, of course, but I won't list them all
here.&nbsp; For a more extensive list, including some based in the UK and Europe, I suggest the
      <a target="_blank" href="http://mailleartisans.org/lynx/index.cgi">Links</a> page of mailleartisans.org<br>


      <br>



Well I think that's just about everything you need to know to get
started, if not a little more.&nbsp; Have fun and good luck!<br>
