      <h1>Constructing European 4:1 and&nbsp;Chain Variants</h1>





      
      
      
      
      <h3>An Alternate Approach</h3>





      <br>
Sooo&hellip;there are a lot of tutorials for making Boxchain.&nbsp; And
there are a lot for making Byzantine, and&nbsp;the Roundmailles.&nbsp;
So if you want to know how to make
those weaves, step-by-step, there are plenty of places you can look,
and I don&rsquo;t have a prayer of offering you more than the likes
of MAIL&rsquo;s archives or Phong&rsquo;s CGI tutorials.<br>





      <br>





So instead of taking the step-by-step, ring-monkey, anyone-can-do-it
approach, I&rsquo;m hoping to teach you the actual theory behind
the weaves.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll show you the basic rules of
construction, and hopefully, once you have that, you&rsquo;ll see
how it works for all of the basic European chain variants.&nbsp;
Ideally, this will cover about ten different tutorials in one fell
swoop.&nbsp; Instead of learning the steps for Boxchain, and the
steps for Byzantine, and for Roundmaille and Inverted Roundmaille, and
then having to ask for a tutorial on Turkish Roundmaille,
you&rsquo;ll actually be able to see how it works on your own.<br>





      <br>





This approach may be a tad more cerebral than the ring-monkey approach,
but I&rsquo;m pretty sure it isn&rsquo;t rocket
science.&nbsp; At any rate, I&rsquo;ve got a digital camera and a web domain, so I can supply plenty of pictures.&nbsp;
Ready?&nbsp; All right, let&rsquo;s begin.<br>





      <br>




      
      
      
      
      <h2>
Basic European 4:1</h2>





We&rsquo;ll start with the mother of all Euro weaves, the classic
4:1 sheet.&nbsp; Theoretically, you can learn this and all else
will follow with just a few permutations.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll get
to those later; for now, E4:1.<br>





      <br>





1.&nbsp; Four closed rings onto one open.&nbsp; This is the
basic credo of all the weaves covered in this tutorial.&nbsp; Close
the open ring, arrange as shown, and what you now have is called a fivelet.<br>


      <img style="width: 361px; height: 300px;" alt="step 1 a" src="images/euro-variants-1a.jpg"> <img style="width: 281px; height: 300px;" alt="step 1 b" src="images/euro-variants-1b.jpg"><br>





      <br>





2.&nbsp; To add to the fivelet, put two closed rings onto one open
&ndash; but don&rsquo;t close the open one.&nbsp; This ring
is going to be just like the one at the center of your fivelet, only it
needs two more closed rings.&nbsp; It shares with the last open
ring, thus:<br>


      <img style="width: 356px; height: 300px;" alt="step 2 a" src="images/euro-variants-2a.jpg"> <img style="width: 387px; height: 300px;" alt="step 2 b" src="images/euro-variants-2b.jpg"><br>





      And close it.<br>


      <br>





3.&nbsp; Keep making triplets and adding them to the last
fivelet.&nbsp; You now have the technique to lengthen the patch as
much as you like.<br>


      
      
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 263px; height: 200px;" alt="step 3 a" src="images/euro-variants-3a.jpg"> <img style="width: 457px; height: 200px;" alt="step 3 b" src="images/euro-variants-3b.jpg"><br>


      </div>





      <br>





4.&nbsp; However, you may have noticed that only the central rings
pass through four others.&nbsp; In E4:1, every ring must go through
four others, and yet here, the rings along the edges only go through
two.&nbsp; This is an incomplete sheet; but, if widened, the edge
rings will have their four-apiece.<br>





      <br>





To do this, you will again make a triplet, but this time attach it to
the first two rings on the bottom edge.&nbsp; Each of those rings
now has three.<br>


      <img style="width: 572px; height: 350px;" alt="step 4 a" src="images/euro-variants-4a.jpg"><br>





      <br>





5.&nbsp; Put just one closed ring on an open ring, and pass it
through its neighbor&rsquo;s two rings &ndash; just like you
were doing in steps 2-3 &ndash; plus one more ring above.<br>


&nbsp;<img style="width: 499px; height: 350px;" alt="step 5 a" src="images/euro-variants-5a.jpg"><br>





      <br>





6.&nbsp; More close-open pairs, added in the same way, clear
through to the end:<br>


      <img style="width: 446px; height: 300px;" alt="step 6 a" src="images/euro-variants-6a.jpg"> <img style="width: 451px; height: 300px;" alt="step 6 b" src="images/euro-variants-6b.jpg"><br>





      <br>





7.&nbsp; You can keep repeating steps 4-6 to widen the chain as
much as you like.&nbsp; Only the edge rings will have a ring ratio
lower than 4:1; every interior ring will have its full
complement.&nbsp; In an ideal, infinite sheet, there would be no
edges and every ring would have its four others.&nbsp; (However, an
infinite sheet is not, um, entirely practical for most mundane
maillers.)<br>


      <img style="width: 467px; height: 400px;" alt="step 7 a" src="images/euro-variants-7a.jpg"><br>





      <br>





All right, you know how to make a European 4:1 rectangle of any
dimensions.&nbsp; Now&hellip;the fun stuff!<br>




      
      
      
      
      <h2>
European 4:1 Chain Variants</h2>





The absolute simplest chain that can be made from E4:1 is
Boxchain.&nbsp; If you stopped after step 3 above, you&rsquo;d
just have this basic ribbon&hellip;<br>


      <img style="width: 457px; height: 200px;" alt="3-ring ribbon" src="images/euro-variants-3b.jpg"><br>





      <br>





&hellip;whose two edges could be connected with a ring going through two rings on either side&hellip;<br>


      <img style="width: 393px; height: 250px;" alt="folding the ribbon" src="images/euro-variants-box-2.jpg">&nbsp;<img style="width: 296px; height: 250px;" alt="connecting the edges" src="images/euro-variants-box-3.jpg"><br>





      <br>





&hellip;all the way down the length of the ribbon&hellip;<br>


      <img style="width: 598px; height: 300px;" alt="the stitches make a seam" src="images/euro-variants-box-4.jpg"><br>





      <br>





&hellip;to make a basic chain!&nbsp; And, hmm, this chain has
four corners and four sides, rather like an extremely long,
narrow&hellip;box&hellip;so we could call
it&hellip;Boxchain&hellip;!<br>


      <img style="width: 590px; height: 300px;" alt="boxchain!" src="images/euro-variants-box-5.jpg"><br>





      <br>





If you stopped after step 6, you&rsquo;d have a ribbon five rows
wide, and if you connected its edges in the same way, you would have a
round, six-sided chain that one might think to call Roundmaille.<br>


      <img style="width: 472px; height: 300px;" alt="first stitch in roundmaille" src="images/euro-variants-round-1.jpg"><br>


      <br>


      <img style="width: 566px; height: 300px;" alt="whole seam" src="images/euro-variants-round-2.jpg"><br>





      <br>





And if, for some reason, you had widened the ribbon to 7 rows and
decided to stitch its edges together, you would have the (rather
obscure and officially nameless) weave that I generally call Fourfold
Roundmaille.<br>





      <img style="width: 539px; height: 300px;" alt="fourfold roundmaille all stitched up" src="images/euro-variants-fourfold-1.jpg"><br>





You could keep doing this, up to 9 and 11 and 13 rows stitched (even
further if you like), but after a certain point it not only stops
looking like a chain and starts looking like a flabby tube, but also
becomes ridiculously boring.&nbsp; (Once you get up around fifty or
so rows, you&rsquo;ve got the sleeve of a hauberk.)<br>





      <br>





So that&rsquo;s the basic European chain.&nbsp; The next thing
(muahaha) to do to it is&hellip;(muahaHAhaha)&hellip; to
permutate it!<br>





      <br>





So let&rsquo;s begin by introducing the...<br>
      <h2>European Basic Chain Weave
Family Tree</h2>





&nbsp;<img style="width: 913px; height: 591px;" alt="European Basic Chain Weave Family Tree" src="images/euro-variants-tree.jpg"><br>





      <br>





Every weave in the top chain is based off of Boxchain; that is, you
can get to it from a ribbon of E4:1 three rows wide (plus stitching
makes four rows, two in each direction, so these can be considered
two-sided weaves).<br>





      <br>





In the middle chain, they&rsquo;re all based off Roundmaille, and
come from a ribbon five rows wide (plus stitching is six, three in each
direction, so three-sided).<br>





      <br>





In the bottom chain, they come from a ribbon seven rows wide (eight
with stitching, so four-sided).<br>





      <br>





In the mailling community at large, the weaves in the middle chain
belong to the bigger group of three-sided weaves, from every family,
which are collectively called the &ldquo;triplicate&rdquo;
weaves.&nbsp; This is a handy naming convention, and it would be
nice to apply to the two- and four-sided chains, but that would, I
believe, make them &ldquo;duplicates&rdquo; and
&ldquo;quadruplicates,&rdquo; respectively, and that really
just doesn&rsquo;t vibe with me.<br>





      <br>





The four colors represent the four basic permutations from the original
Euro ribbon.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The aluminum weaves are the simplest chain
derivatives of European 4:1, which we&rsquo;ve just gone
over.&nbsp; That is, each one is made from a ribbon folded around
and stitched.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">





      <br style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">
      <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">
The green weaves are a hybrid of the aluminum and the yellow weaves.
&nbsp;They are single units of the aluminum weaves separated by single
units of the yellow ones.</span><br>

      <br>
      <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 102);">
The yellow weaves are the inverted Euro chain weaves.&nbsp; These are
basically like European sheets turned 90&ordm;, rolled up, and
stitched.&nbsp; However, it isn&rsquo;t that simple, because
the grain is slightly different.&nbsp; You know how, when you look
edge-on at European 4:1, it does this sort of thing: /\/\/\.&nbsp;
Well, with the inverses, the &ldquo;valleys&rdquo;
don&rsquo;t come back up into
&ldquo;mountains.&rdquo; &nbsp;They keep curving
around, and in this way, they form a
hollow chain:</span><br style="color: rgb(255, 255, 102);">
      <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 102);">



/&macr;\</span><br style="color: rgb(255, 255, 102);">
      <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 102);">



\_/</span><br style="color: rgb(255, 255, 102);">
      <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 102);">




      That's a bit hard to understand, and it probably won't
help you to make the weave. &nbsp;This is why it is easier to think of
it as a permutation of the first weave. &nbsp;When you are adding on to
the end of a Boxchain or Roundmaille, the rings tend to flip around in
a way that can be really annoying, except when you want to make the
inverted version, because you just have to let them flip to that
natural state and&nbsp;they're inverted.</span><br>

      <br>
      <span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">
The bronze weaves are the captive inverted weaves.&nbsp; Simply, they
are the inverted weaves with at least one ring captured in each unit (a
captive ring does not pass through any other rings, but is trapped
mechanically in place by the rings around it).&nbsp; Theoretically,
these aren&rsquo;t very significant, but CIR is at least a fairly
common weave, and they have a nice aesthetic quality. &nbsp;All of the
samples shown have only one captive per unit, but depending on ring
size it is possible to get up to two or three captives per unit.</span><br>

      <br>

You'll notice that I don't have samples of the fourfold inverted
chains. &nbsp;That's because, as you get more and more rows into the
chain, it starts resisting inversion. &nbsp;The triplicate inverted
round weave is already quite stiff; I tried to make the fourfold but,
with the ring sizes I have, &nbsp;couldn't get it any longer than about
two units long. &nbsp;Only one person, to my knowledge, has bothered to
make fourfold&nbsp;(or, as he calls it, Quad) captive inverted round.
&nbsp;I tried but couldn't replicate his ring sizes, so here's the link
to his picture:<br>

      <h2>
&nbsp;A Note on Inverted Boxchain</h2>
It is occasionally assumed that the inverse of Boxchain is Full Persian
6:1.&nbsp; This is probably because they can both be made from the
same initial 2-2-2 chain (though with different initial arrangements),
and because they have a similar four-sided structure.&nbsp; While
there is a visual similarity, I submit that these two weaves are not
inverses of each other, but more like parallel branches of their
respective families.&nbsp; The real inverse of Boxchain is in
fact &ndash; this may be a monumental anticlimax, but
I&rsquo;ll show you the proof in a moment &ndash; a
4-2&nbsp;chain.&nbsp; Yep, that's it, just a unit chain. &nbsp;So
what&rsquo;s the deal with Box and
FP?&nbsp; Well, you can think of it this way: Box is to FP as
Roundmaille (three-sided box) is to Hilt Chain (three-sided Persian),
and as a 2-1 chain (half of Box) is to Half Persian 3:1 (half of FP).<br>
      <img style="width: 913px; height: 322px;" alt="european vs persian variants" src="images/euro-variants-euro-persian.jpg"><br>
      <br>
As for why FP is NOT the Boxchain inverse, there are a lot of ways to
prove this.&nbsp; The first one is obvious: Box is a European
weave, and FP is a Persian weave.&nbsp; That doesn&rsquo;t make
them inverses, it makes them distant cousins at best.&nbsp; Next
up: Box is a 4:1 weave, whereas FP is a 6:1 weave.&nbsp; Now, remember
that 4 rings onto 1 is supposed to be the credo of all the weaves in
this tutorial, because they are all based off European 4:1. &nbsp;And
it
really doesn&rsquo;t seem right that the ring ratio should change just
for the inverse of boxchain,
does it?&nbsp; Not when Inverted Roundmaille still has the same
4:1 ratio as plain Roundmaille.&nbsp; And come to that, FP really
doesn&rsquo;t look anything like Inverted Roundmaille.&nbsp;
The connections are completely different.&nbsp; Inverted RM
doesn&rsquo;t have a trace of a Persian connection, whereas FP,
well, <span style="font-style: italic;">Full Persian</span>&hellip;is pure Persian connections.<br>
      <br>





Why the 4-2 Unit Chain IS the inverse to Boxchain:&nbsp; Again,
there are several ways to prove this.&nbsp; For example, imagine
starting from Inverted Roundmaille.&nbsp; To make the quadruplicate
version, you would add a column of rings; therefore, to make the
duplicate version, you would remove a column in the same way.&nbsp;
Try it sometime, it would be an interesting exercise.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll get a 4-2 chain.<br>





      <br>





Another way to look at it is by comparing the hybrid
weaves:&nbsp; Byzantine, Turkish Roundmaille, and Celtic
Roundmaille.&nbsp; In the latter two, the segments between the orbs
are simply the inverse of each weave.&nbsp; In Turkish Roundmaille,
they are Inverted Roundmaille.&nbsp; In Celtic Roundmaille, they
are Quad Inverted Roundmaille.&nbsp; So what are they in
Byzantine?&nbsp; Have a look on the Family Tree above and you&rsquo;ll see two
rings.&nbsp; Not a Full Persian unit; just two rings, or a single
unit of a 2-2-2 chain.<br>
