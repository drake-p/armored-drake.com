      <h1>Handmade Toggle Clasp</h1>
I don't know about you, but it is my personal opinion that a clasp can
make or break a piece of jewelry. &nbsp;I hate using silver lobster
clasps for everything. &nbsp;And sometimes I make&nbsp;things in a
metal that's extremely difficult to buy a matching clasp for, like
enameled copper or anodized aluminum. &nbsp;Handmade hook clasps can
work for a lot of those scenarios, but they get old; besides, brittle
metals like titanium can be extremely difficult to make into a hook.
&nbsp;Sometimes what you really need is a toggle made from the same
materials as the rest of the piece. &nbsp;Well, just guess what I'm
about to explain how to do.<br>

      <br>
In this tutorial, I'll be making a toggle with a 10 AWG (12 SWG) 1/2"
ID big copper ring, a 14 AWG (16 SWG) toggle bar, and 20 ga copper wire
wrap.<br>
      <br>
We'll start with the big ring. &nbsp;If you're confident in the
strength of your metal, you don't really need to wrap it, but it looks
good and it's nice to have the guarantee. &nbsp;So get your big ring
ready, close it, polish it if you like, but there's no need to solder
unless you're paranoid. &nbsp;Which is okay. &nbsp;But not necessary.<br>
      <br>
If you're using a small gauge for your big ring, you may want to
double-wrap it, splitring style. &nbsp;A single 20 ga ring will look
(and maybe actually be) flimsy.<br>
      <br>
1. &nbsp;Cut off several inches of your thin, soft wire -- say six, and
you can always trim later. &nbsp;Using roundnose pliers or a mandrel,
make a double loop at about the midpoint. &nbsp;This will be the part
that you use to connect the toggle to the rest of the chain, so make it
just big enough to accomodate the rings in your main weave.<br>
      <img style="width: 400px; height: 166px;" alt="step 1: double loop" src="images/toggle-step1.jpg"><br>
      <br>
2. &nbsp;Again using roundnose pliers if you've got them, bend the
tails of the wire around toward each other. &nbsp;Leave enough of a gap
to slip the big ring down to rest by the double loop.<br>
      <img style="width: 400px; height: 298px;" alt="step 2" src="images/toggle-step2A.jpg"> <img style="width: 237px; height: 298px;" alt="step 2 with big ring" src="images/toggle-step2B.jpg"><br>
      <br>
3. &nbsp;Now start wrapping the big ring with the tails of the wire.
&nbsp;This will be a little challenging with two or three inches of
wire to bend through the center of the ring, but just keep at it, and
maybe find that vice/clamp/friend with pliers if you think it'll help.
&nbsp;Oh and before you get too far, be sure that your double loop is
centered on the closure of the big ring and sticking straight out.<br>
      <img style="width: 400px; height: 362px;" alt="step 3" src="images/toggle-step3.jpg"><br>
      <br>
4. &nbsp;Just keep wrapping. &nbsp;It'll get easier as your wire tails
get shorter. &nbsp;I generally wrap to the point where the double loop
is snug, then wrap once or twice more, and finish with the wire ends
pointing DOWN, away from the center of the ring (where they're less
visible).<br>
      <img style="width: 400px; height: 285px;" alt="step 4: trimmed" src="images/toggle-step4A.jpg">&nbsp;<img style="width: 350px; height: 285px;" alt="step 4: finished" src="images/toggle-step4B.jpg"><br>
      <br>
Yay! &nbsp;The first part's done! &nbsp;Now we make the handlebar.<br>
      <br>
5. &nbsp;Get the wire that's the same gauge as or slightly smaller than
your big ring. &nbsp;Straighten it out and lay it across the diameter
of the big ring. &nbsp;Cut it so that you have a fair amount of extra
on either side, remembering that it's always easier to trim down than
up at the end.<br>
      <img style="width: 400px; height: 312px;" alt="step 6" src="images/toggle-step5.jpg"><br>
      <br>
6. &nbsp;Straighten the wire as best you can, and then put a big V-bend in the very center.<br>
      <img style="width: 400px; height: 270px;" alt="step 6: V-bend" src="images/toggle-step6.jpg"><br>
      <br>
7. &nbsp;Now straighten it out on either side of the bend so that
you've got a bike-handle shape. &nbsp;This is to give the bar some
dimensionality, so your wire-wrap will have something to grip instead
of just sliding off the end. &nbsp;*If you are using a small gauge,
like 20 ga, you may want to skip the handlebar shape entirely and
instead curl the very ends of the wire, as in the purple one.* &nbsp;Or
you may use some entirely different shape. &nbsp;It's just important to
have something to hold on to the wire wrap.<br>
      <img style="width: 500px; height: 183px;" alt="step 7" src="images/toggle-step7A.jpg"> <img style="width: 287px; height: 183px;" alt="curled ends" src="images/toggle-step7B.jpg"><br>
      <br>
8. &nbsp;Okay now you know the drill, cut several inches of small wire,
double loop in the middle, bend it back around and slide the handlebar
in place.<br>
      <img style="width: 400px; height: 314px;" alt="step 8" src="images/toggle-step8.jpg"><br>
      <br>
9. &nbsp;Easier to wrap this time than it was with the big ring.
&nbsp;Remember as you wind the tails around to keep the double loop
coming off the <span style="font-style: italic;">bottom</span> of the handlebar.<br>
      <img style="width: 400px; height: 280px;" alt="step 9" src="images/toggle-step9.jpg"><br>
      <br>
10. &nbsp;How far you wrap this one is up to you. &nbsp;You can do the
whole thing, or just enough to keep it stable. &nbsp;With smaller
gauges you may want to do the whole thing, for strength. &nbsp;Remember
to finish with the tails facing down. &nbsp;Trim and wrap them snugly
so they won't snag.<br>
      <img style="width: 400px; height: 242px;" alt="step 10" src="images/toggle-step10.jpg"><br>
      <br>
11. &nbsp;Final check against the big ring. &nbsp;Trim if necessary to
get the bar even on both sides, and then I strongly, strongly suggest
that you file the ends. &nbsp;Did I mention how strongly I suggest that
you file the ends?<br>
      <img style="width: 400px; height: 335px;" alt="step 11" src="images/toggle-step11.jpg"> <img style="width: 380px; height: 335px;" alt="finished toggle clasp" src="images/toggle-finished.jpg"><br>
      <br>
Now that you've learned this, the possibilities are endless.<br>
