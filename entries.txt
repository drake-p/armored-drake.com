You  are  great.    My  father  John  Visser  sent  me  a  link  to  your  website.<br />I  am  a  wardrobe  stylist  in  San  Francisco,<br />and  would  love  to  use  some  of  your  chainmail  in  a  photo  shoot  or  two.    I  <br />would  love  to  get  it  into  a  magazine  so  <br />that  you  would  get  credit  and  your  website  would  be  listed.    If  you  are  <br />interested  in  getting  some  images  of  <br />your  work  in  a  fashion  pictorial  with  <br />proffessional  models,  styling  and  <br />photography  please  let  me  know.    <br />Perhaps  I  can  come  view  your  stuff<br />in  person  next  time  I  am  in  GR.</p><p>Good  Job!</p><p>Pirjo  Visser</p><div class="date">Tuesday, February 7, 2006 @ 1:27 pm</div></div>

I  saw  pics  of  your  work  on  M.A.I.L.  and  had  to  see  more  of  what  you  do.  Your  jewlery  is  some  of  the  better  work  I've  seen  and  is  a  lot  like  what  I  take  to  sell  at  faire.  The  armoring  pices  a  equally  well  crafted  but  do  need  some  refinements,  but  still  they  do  look  great.</p><div class="date">Saturday, September 24, 2005 @ 11:41 am</div></div>
