finally happening. &nbsp;Fancy new logos, updated pictures without
watermarks because they were ugly and in the way, a navigation bar at
the top of every page, and sleeker gallery index pages. &nbsp;Also, a
lot of my tutorials have new photos, and I got rid of the ones that
were pretty much the same as others have done before me (basic weave
construction for Boxchain, Byzantine, HP3, Inverted RM).&nbsp; There's also some less exciting behind-the-scenes file hierarchy
revision that makes me a lot happier, although it's not visible to you
the visitor. &nbsp;Plus the usual stuff: in four months I've come up with a few new pieces and one entirely brand new tutorial, <a href="tutorials/handmade_toggle.html">Handmade Toggle Clasp</a>.</td>

this is rather

last
post promising a new site, and, quite frankly, there is nothing new to
be seen!<br>




Reader, I have a confession.<br>




Last night at 1:00 AM I had two hundred pages left to read of <span style="font-style: italic;">Les Miserables</span>.
&nbsp;The week before, at 12:30 AM, I was finishing a seven-page
English essay, and the night before that it was a book report for
Chemistry. &nbsp;The truth is, I've been swamped; the quicksand has
me,
and I'm sinking past the hips. &nbsp;I have twelve weeks left in
high
school. &nbsp;I have a fatal combination of senioritis -- that
plague
of twelfth graders -- and four advanced classes. &nbsp;Reader, this
is
my humble excuse; I entreat your forgiveness, kind soul, and ask you to
understand that the promised update may be rather farther in the future
than I had anticipated.</td>

            <td align="left" valign="top">So the
good news is, this
site is in for a bit of a re-design. &nbsp;I've been working on a
new
version behind the scenes, and will upload it all at once when it's
ready. &nbsp;But here's the bad news: about three days into the
work, I
got hit with a nasty&nbsp;cold that has reduced my higher brain
functions to approximately those of a latter-day Neanderthal.
&nbsp;SO,
instead of trying to work and ending up lobbing the computer mouse at
the nearest Cro-Magnon, I'm just taking it easy for a few days
(armchair with cat on lap and cough drops close at hand).
&nbsp;Which
was all a lengthy explanation for: this site will be revamped, later
than I expected, but probably within the next week or so.

with the
graphics on the site a bit; the links at the tops of the main pages
should now be a little more visible, and the image in the HTML bar at
the top of the page is different.&nbsp; If you've been here before,
you
may need to reload the page to see any difference.&nbsp; Also,
added
some new <a href="NewPictures.html#SEP05">pictures</a>,
and changed the
pictures on the Other Pictures page into thumbnails for larger pics
(rather than just miniscule pictures).<br>

news!&nbsp; Eye
Candy, a gallery in Grand Rapids, Michigan, has taken notice of my
work.&nbsp; I now have about a dozen necklaces and bracelets on
consignment there.&nbsp; The address is 1479 Lake Drive, Grand
Rapids,
MI, USA, in case any of my site visitors are passing through that way
and want to take a look.&nbsp; Also, added some new <a href="NewPictures.html#AUG05">pictures</a>.<br>

200 visitors
to the website since January 17, I've decided that it has sufficiently
matured for me to justify
having a page
devoted to updates.&nbsp; Also, I finally got a couple rolls
of film developed and added a whole bunch of new <a href="NewPictures.html#MAR05">pictures</a>, as well as
a new
"Other
Pictures" catch-all page.<br>
