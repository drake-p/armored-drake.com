Yes...twelve days. &nbsp;I did this sucker in TWELVE DAYS.
&nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Goodness knows. &nbsp;I think chainmaille
has affected my sanity. &nbsp;Maybe I was just trying to prove
something. &nbsp;Anyway, I did it, and took progress pictures
(almost) every day. &nbsp;So I have laid out my progress
chronologically below.<br>

Spring Break began, and with it began my
long-planned shirt. &nbsp;At this point, I had pre-cut about 3/4 of
the
rings that I was going to need, and I was hoping to finish the project
before Spring Break ended April 9 (this did not, in the end, happen,
but I was hopeful for the first few days). &nbsp;My bronze wire for the inlay was already on its way, coming from TRL in
Saskatchewan, Canada.</div>

      <div style="margin-left: 40px;">

Did a fair portion of the back panel. &nbsp;Had to
stop toward mid-afternoon due to a headache (possibly unrelated) and a
killer blister on my right palm (definitely related).<br>


      <br>




By the
way, see my pliers there on the right side of the picture, hanging off
the edge a bit? &nbsp;And see how they've got masking tape wadded
around one
handle? &nbsp;Lemme tell ya, I could not have done this project
without that
bit of padding. &nbsp;It is a *wonderful* little trick for marathon
work
like this.</div>

Speed-wove something like fifteen rows,
amounting to a total of thirty (speedweaving is when you weave two rows
at once). &nbsp;The TRL order was approaching, but as
the next day was a Sunday, I didn't expect it until the 3rd.<br>


      <br>




It
was at this point that I masking-tape-padded my other pair of linesmans
pliers and started alternating them, one in my hand and one on an
ice-pack, so that I could keep working.</div>

As my right hand was not in the greatest shape
due to work from the previous day, I did very little. &nbsp;I
framed the
section where the inlay would go, but that was all. &nbsp;You can
see my
pattern for the inlay sitting in the place where the inlay itself would
be going.</div>

The TRL order arrived,&nbsp;my bronze wire
included. &nbsp;It took about a 5 foot length of coil to complete
the inlay,
but by golly, I finished that ENTIRE section in ONE DAY -- including
cutting all the bronze rings.</div>

Due to the inlay marathon I did on the 3rd, I took a day off on the 4th
to play with the various other things I had gotten with my TRL order.
&nbsp;This included my first patch of scales, my first AA/neoprene
bracelets, and starting to sort through the 5 lbs of floor sweepings I
had gotten.<br>


      <br>




Once I got back to work on the 5th, I completed the task of joining the
two sides. &nbsp;Work was roughly equivalent to half the front
panel. &nbsp;My hands seemed to&nbsp;reach a state of nirvana
at this point: the blister on my right hand had fully formed into
callous, and my forearms didn't ache at&nbsp;all. &nbsp;Could
have kept mailling quite a while, but my psychological endurance hadn't
quite caught up to the physical. &nbsp;Plus, it was nearly one in
the morning.</div>

Unfortunately I don't have pictures from these days, there was some
sort of trouble with my camera. &nbsp;I do however have a later
picture of the sleeve, which was completed over the course of these two
days.<br>


      <br>




Day
8: Finished the main sheets for both sleeves, 21 x 42 rings,
open-hanging. &nbsp;Started the triangle that will form the armpit
seam on
one arm.<br>


      <br>




Day
9: Finished sleeves and started lengthening the bottom edge.
&nbsp;And
then...I ran out of wire. *sob* It was bound to happen someday.

And here's where
the pictures get confusing...I was bad about labeling these last few,
so I don't know what day this is, and you can't even see the bottom
edge, which is the part I was working on.<br>




      <br>




After taking a long break while I gathered wire and rings, I
returned to work on weaving the bottom edge. &nbsp;Added about 5
more rows
to the bottom edge, which is a fair day's work.</div>
